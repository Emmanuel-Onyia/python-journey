# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository documents my daily Python learning focused on cloud engineering and cybersecurity.

## Repository Structure
Each session has its own folder with scripts and notes.

## Sessions

### ✅ Session 1 — Python Basics
- Variables and data types  
- User input & output 
- Simple authentication logic  
- Python indentation rules 
- Linux terminal usage 


### Session 2 - Core Data Types & Variables 
Task — User Profile Script

In this session, I built a Python script that collects user input and uses variables and type conversion to process the data.

The program:
- Asks for the user's name, birth year, city, and favourite colour
- Converts input into the correct data types
- Calculates the user’s age
- Displays formatted output using Python variables

This project strengthened my understanding of how Python handles input, data types, and basic calculations.
