# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository documents my Python learning journey with a focus on cloud engineering and cybersecurity fundamentals.

## Repository Structure
Each session has its own folder containing scripts and exercises completed during that session.

## Sessions

### ✅ Session 1 — Python Basics
- Variables and data types  
- User input and output  
- Simple authentication logic  
- Python indentation rules  
- Using Python from the Linux terminal  

---

### ✅ Session 2 — Core Data Types & Variables
**Task: User Profile Script**

In this session, I built a Python script that collects user input and processes it using variables and type conversion.

The program:
- Prompts for the user’s name, birth year, city, and favourite colour  
- Converts input into appropriate data types  
- Calculates the user’s age  
- Displays formatted output using Python variables  

This session reinforced how Python handles user input, data types, and basic calculations.

### ✅ Session 3 — Conditionals & Basic Logic

This session focused on Python’s decision-making capabilities and writing programs that respond dynamically to user input.

#### Concepts Covered
- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements  
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)  
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`)  
- Input validation and type conversion  
- Modulo operator (`%`) for even/odd checks  

#### Hands-On Tasks
- Number classification (positive, negative, zero)  
- Age group categorization  
- Simple login validation  
- Even and odd number detection  

#### Session Challenge
Built a grading system that:
- Accepts a score between 0 and 100  
- Validates input range  
- Converts numeric scores into letter grades (A–F)  
- Outputs a clean, user-friendly result  

This session strengthened my ability to write structured, readable logic—an essential skill for scripting, automation, and backend workflows.
